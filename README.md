This is my hobby project, that I have started because I wished to deeply explore
C++ metaprogramming. I have implemented a lot of cool metaprogramming stuff,
which actually may seem as a "black magic". 

Here you can see such algorithms as lexicographic comparsion, generation,
conditional removing and even sorting. And it all is performed at compile-time 
with _types_, not material values. And it all is implemented using pure C++ 11 
standard.

You can read the 
[documentation of a project](https://glebzlat.github.io/type_pack/), 
almost all features are documented.
